{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1641833820,"Headline":"Apple: Huge Moat, but Valuation Leaves Little Upside","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Apple (AAPL) is a multinational company that operates in the computer hardware, computer software, consumer electronics, and online services industries. \n\n\n\nThe company was formed about 45 years ago in 1976, and has since experienced significant growth. As of 2021, Apple had a total of 516 retail stores across the globe and more than 147,000 employees. Its headquarters are located in California and the company has launched nine different products until now, with several variations of each. \n\n\n\nReportedly, there are 1.65 billion Apple products currently in use around the world. What began as a personal computer producer and distributor company has now expanded into a world-renowned brand of gadgets and technologies.\u00a0\n\n\n\nI am neutral on Apple despite it having a very strong moat, Wall Street analyst bullishness, and a very profitable business model. This is because AAPL trades a massive valuation multiple premium, and the average price target implies that the stock has little to no upside over the next year.\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\n\nApple is considered the world\u2019s most valuable company with the highest brand loyalty. It was the first publicly traded, U.S.-based company that was valued at $1 trillion in 2018, and it beat its own record in 2020 when it was valued at $2 trillion. This year, Apple briefly hit a market cap of $3 trillion. \n\n\n\nThe company has one of the strongest global footprints, with physical stores in 24 countries and online stores in approximately 100 countries. Its proprietary hardware, software, services, and applications also give it a unique edge over its competitors. \n\n\n\nStrong advertising and marketing tactics have landed Apple the most loyal customers across the globe. Since its inception, Apple has come a long way, and the brand has created an unrivaled value in the market.\n\n\n\nRecent Results\n\n\n\nIn Q4 2021, which ended in September, Apple increased its total net sales to $83.36 billion, compared to the previous year\u2019s quarterly results, which showed total net sales of $64.7 billion. Total net sales for 2020 and 2021 reached $274.5 billion and $365.8 billion, respectively. Basic and diluted earnings per share in Q4 2021 were $1.25 and $1.24, respectively, taking the yearly numbers to $5.67 for both share types.\n\n\n\nLooking at its balance sheet, its cash & cash equivalents decreased from $36 billion in 2020 to $34.93 billion in Q3 2021.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\n\nValuation Metrics\n\n\n\nAAPL stock looks richly priced at the moment. Its forward enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is sky-high relative to its history at 22.8 times compared to its historical average of 13.7 times. Moreover, its forward price-to-normalized-earnings ratio is also very elevated at 30.21 times compared to its historical average of 20.41 times.\n\n\n\nWall Street\u2019s Take\n\n\n\nTurning to Wall Street, AAPL has earned a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buy ratings, four Hold ratings, and one Sell rating in the past three months. Additionally, the average\u00a0Apple price target\u00a0of $175.28 puts the upside potential at 1.8%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n\n\nApple stock is backed by one of the strongest moats in the world as the Apple brand is the most powerful consumer electronics brand on the globe. As a result, the company generates very consistent and hefty profits from its products.\n\n\n\nThat said, the stock has been on an extended run lately, pushing the valuation far above historical averages. Furthermore, the average Wall Street analyst price target implies that the stock will not move much over the next year. As a result, investors might want to wait for a pullback before adding shares.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0&\u00a0Disclosure"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=af5d28246f750c24ff6cef0b06000a93096c33d65cd9154fd6113eef70192e3b"}

{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1641794100,"Headline":"Big Tech Stocks: What\u2019s in Store for 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Big tech stocks have witnessed a fair amount of selling over the past month. Valuation concerns and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic led to a selloff in tech stocks. The chart below shows that big tech companies are trading in the red, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platform (NASDAQ:FB) barely managed to stay in the green over the past month.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith tech stocks currently under pressure, let\u2019s look at each of these tech giants to ascertain what the future holds for them in 2022.\n\n\n\nApple\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite supply-chain concerns, Apple delivered a solid financial performance in FY21. Strong sales across all product categories and strength across all of its geographies drove Apple\u2019s financials, and in turn, its stock, which outperformed the benchmark index in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, demand for Apple products is likely to outpace supply, as noted by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst is bullish on Apple stock. He sees higher demand and the easing of supply-chain issues in the first half of 2022 as a tailwind for Apple stock. Moreover, Ives noted that higher average selling prices provide a multi-year growth opportunity.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBesides robust demand and higher selling prices, Ives expects Apple to gain from its growing market share in China.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, the majority of analysts are bullish on Apple stock. Its Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, hedge funds have been selling Apple stock. TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have\u00a0sold 4 million Apple shares\u00a0over the past three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAmazon\u00a0\n\n\n\nTough comparisons, cost inflation, and supply-chain disruptions weighed on Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) financial performance in 2021, and in turn, its stock price. Amazon stock underperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index by a wide margin in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGiven the near-term challenges, investors and hedge funds have a negative outlook on Amazon stock. TipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that about 1.3% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold\u00a0AMZN stock\u00a0in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, hedge funds have lowered their holdings by 576.2K shares in three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Monness analyst Brian White is bullish on Amazon for 2022. He expects Amazon\u2019s growth to accelerate in the 2H22. Further, White noted that AWS\u2019 (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, while Amazon is well-positioned to benefit from an \u201caccelerated digital transformation.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlong with White, most Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Amazon stock. AMZN has received 30 positive analyst reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlphabet\n\n\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock delivered strong returns in 2021 and outperformed its peers, thanks to the stellar recovery in ad sales and the strength of its cloud business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Alphabet could benefit from higher advertising revenues and growth in the cloud segment. Further, its balance sheet and cash flows remain strong.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTaking note of its strong cash flows, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial stated that Alphabet would continue to boost shareholders\u2019 returns through share buybacks and fund its growth initiatives on the back of its robust cash flows.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFeinseth sees Alphabet benefiting from secular tech trends, including video sharing, cloud computing, growing mobile engagement, and the ongoing shift to digital advertising, among others.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn TipRanks, Alphabet stock sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buy and 2 Hold recommendations. Furthermore,\u00a01.9% of the investors\u00a0holding portfolios on TipRanks have increased their exposure to GOOGL stock over the last 30 days.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks to the strength in its cloud business, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock increased over 49% in one year and outperformed the benchmark index. Despite the appreciation in its share price, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is upbeat about Microsoft\u2019s prospects and maintains a bullish outlook on the stock. Thill increased his price target on Microsoft to $400 from $375.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThill sees Microsoft as the \u201csafest largecap investment option\u201d with multiple growth vectors. The analyst expects Microsoft to continue to enhance shareholder value on the back of its strong profitability and free cash flows. However, he expects Microsoft\u2019s top-line growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, on TipRanks, Microsoft stock has received 24 Buys and 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Furthermore, it scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Smart Score system, indicating that MSFT stock could outperform the market averages.\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms\u00a0\n\n\n\nFacebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to better reflect a metaverse company. However, investors and hedge funds continue to dump their stock.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that about 0.7% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold\u00a0FB stock\u00a0in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have\u00a0sold 1.7 million Meta Platforms\u00a0shares over the past three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMonness analyst Brian White noted, \u201cThe longer-term journey for Facebook became more intriguing in the later part of 2021 with the company introducing its vision for the metaverse, followed by a name change to Meta Platforms.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, he expects Apple\u2019s app tracking transparency to continue to hurt Meta Platforms in the future.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNevertheless, he maintains a Buy rating on Meta Platforms and expects it to benefit from favorable digital ad trends and digital transformation opportunities. Meanwhile, on TipRanks, FB stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys and 5 Holds.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Amit Singh had no position in any of the companies discussed in this article.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates \u00a0Read full disclaimer >"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=1ad7ecad6f79af73a490aeb5d07b2c44237170a1621ad933f89c841e7c8d7063"}

{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1641875760,"Headline":"These 2 \u2018Perfect 10\u2019 Stocks Could Trend Higher in 2022","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"We can see that there is a genuine unease in the market at the start of the Q4 results season, as the Omicron strain of COVID-19 has spread and market volatility has edged higher, owing to rising rate fears.\n\n\n\nThese anticipated interest rate rises will be good news for a few industries, such as banking, but bad news for others, such as the construction industry, as interest hikes will raise borrowing costs.\n\n\n\nIn such a market scenario, investors are likely looking for quality picks to avoid being harmed by the continued selloff. Solid corporate earnings releases from large banks like Citigroup (C) and JPMorgan (JPM) on January 14 may, however, boost investor optimism by the end of the week.\n\n\n\nIn light of this, TipRanks' Smart Score System is a great tool for investors, since it allows them to evaluate a company in greater depth.\n\n\n\nThis technique takes eight important factors into consideration, such as hedge fund and insider trading activity, and provides a score to the equities on a scale of 1 to 10. Stocks with a 'Perfect 10' score are more likely to outperform the market than those with a lower score. As a consequence, it supports investors in putting together a portfolio that will maximize returns.\n\n\n\nUsing TipRanks' Top Smart Score Stocks, we discovered two stocks that scored a \"Perfect 10\" on the Smart Score scale. Both these stocks also have a Strong Buy average rating.\n\n\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\n\n\nApple is a worldwide corporation that has received a \"Perfect 10\" rating for the past three days. The corporation is regarded as the most valuable in the world, with the highest brand loyalty.\n\n\n\nDespite supply-chain worries, Apple's fiscal fourth-quarter 2021 earnings were excellent. Sales increased by 29% year-over-year to $83.4 billion. In addition, earnings of $1.24 per share were up 69.9% over the year-ago quarter. Apple's financials were driven by strong sales across all product categories.\n\n\n\nOn January 27, Apple is anticipated to release its upcoming earnings, which might function as a catalyst for the stock.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, the company should continue to thrive across all business segments, as noted by Citigroup analyst Jim Suva. Apple stock provides a variety of reasons for the analyst to stay positive.\n\n\n\nFirst, Suva expects Apple to continue to expand its revenue, owing to robust iPhone demand and expansion in associated services. He also feels that the virtual\/augmented reality business \"is poised for growth,\" and that Apple will profit from his upcoming hardware launches, which include a virtual\/augmented reality headset. Suva goes on to say that Apple's aggressive approach of returning cash to shareholders through dividends and stock repurchases should continue to benefit the business.\n\n\n\nAs a consequence, Suva raised his price objective $200 from $170, implying about 16.2% rise in value from present levels.\n\n\n\nOverall, the Apple stock forecast is a Strong Buy, according to consensus from Wall Street analysts, with 26 recent assessments, including 21 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The stock is now trading at $172.19 and the average AAPL price target of $175.28 implies around 1.8% upside from that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSony Group (SONY)\n\n\n\nSony Group is another consumer electronics company that has achieved a \"Perfect 10\" in the last three days.\n\n\n\nThe Japanese multinational has a wide business portfolio that includes professional and consumer electronics manufacturing, film production, and gaming publishing.\n\n\n\nRecently, Sony declared its ambition to enter the electric vehicle space with new products at the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The business showed an SUV version of its VISION-S concept electric vehicle. Interestingly, Sony has formed a separate firm, Sony Mobility, to focus solely on electric vehicles. Kenichiro Yoshida, Sony's CEO, has stated that the company is \"exploring a commercial launch\" for its EV.\n\n\n\nWith the latest news in mind, Morgan Stanley analyst Masahiro Ono maintained his optimistic outlook on Sony and confirmed his Overweight rating.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ono, Sony intends to influence the future of the mobility sector with sensor technology, 5G and cloud connection, and content that transforms the car interior into an entertainment zone. In the medium run, he expects these contributions to boost the company's profitability.\n\n\n\nOverall, on TipRanks, Sony Group stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 3 unanimous Buys. The shares are priced at $123.17 and the average SONY price target of $150 implies around 21.8% upside from that level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy,\u00a0a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0&\u00a0Disclosure"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=ad1d9545b3462cbc1873184387505a672f40fc8e27086ec61df9c4955e91f479"}

{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1642584600,"Headline":"Could Macro Events Have Bitten into Apple\u2019s Q1?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"The interest rate hike speculations have kept technology stocks most susceptible to sell-offs in the past few weeks. Being one of the leading tech companies, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has also borne the brunt of these sell-offs, to some extent. In their flight, investors of growth stocks have eaten off 6.71% of the AAPL stock price since the beginning of January.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQ1: The Strengths and Weaknesses\n\n\n\nNonetheless, ahead of its 1QF22 earnings results that are awaited on January 27, Monness Crespi Hardt analyst Brian White believes that Apple can be a good bet, despite the tense environment of the economy. \u201cDuring this crisis, we believe Apple has enhanced its value proposition in the eyes of the world by introducing new innovations, supporting a more digital lifestyle, and attracting new users to Planet Apple,\u201d he weighed in.\n\n\n\nThe company did not issue official guidance for 1QF22, and White expects Apple to beat his revenue projection of $118.68 (6% year-over-year growth), and EPS projection of $1.93.\n\n\n\nWhite, however, sees a few setbacks looming over the quarter-to-be reported. He observes that his 1Q:FY22 revenue forecast reflects a 42% sequential growth, which is much lower than the 54% average sequential growth that was observed in the December quarters over the past four years. This means significant deceleration in revenue growth.\n\n\n\nMoreover, White believes that revenues from iPhone sales will record year-over-year growth, but sharply lower at around 2%, compared to 47% in the prior year Q4. \u201cWork-from-home has driven strong demand for PCs and tablets; however, we expect this phenomenon to wane in FY:22,\u201d said White, justifying his revenue prediction.\n\n\n\nComing to revenues from the Mac series of products, an 8% year-over-year growth is expected. However, White looks at a 3% decline in iPad sales for 1QF22.\n\n\n\nFY22 Looks Positive, But Not Quite\n\n\n\nFor the full-year fiscal 2022, White expects a significant deceleration in revenue growth, at only 8%. This is more because of outside factors than due to any fundamental issue. Apple\u2019s fiscal 2021 experienced a cocktail of favorable factors, like benefiting from the work-from-home wave, massive demand for digital content during lockdowns, Huawei\u2019s fall from grace, and a delayed iPhone 12 upgrade cycle resulting in additional pent-up demand. These factors led to a 33% growth in FY21 revenues, against 6% growth in the preceding fiscal year.\n\n\n\n\u201cIn our view, growth of this magnitude is unsustainable and the impact of a post-lockdown hangover unclear,\u201d opined White, explaining his reservations about the company\u2019s performance for the year.\n\n\n\nHowever, the strong services business that Apple has built over the years has given the market confidence about its long-term prospects.

{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1642658700,"Headline":"Microsoft vs. Apple: Which Stock is Headed for Growth in 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"When it comes to pure-play technology companies like Microsoft and Apple, website traffic data is an important tool. This is because, for these companies, most of the retailing takes place online. This is especially true when it comes to selling software and devices such as smartphones, PCs, and wearables to individual customers.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks stock comparison tool, we will compare two technology giants, Microsoft and Apple, and see whether their performance in the December quarter can be gauged using the Website Traffic tool on TipRanks. We will also look at what Wall Street analysts are saying about these stocks.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\n\n\nMicrosoft dominated the headlines recently as it announced an all-cash acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for $68.7 billion. Analysts believe that this acquisition will extend the company\u2019s footprint in the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nWhile this acquisition bodes well for MSFT when it comes to its gaming business, it will be interesting to see how MSFT\u2019s key cloud business fares in the upcoming earnings for fiscal Q2. MSFT earnings for fiscal Q2 are expected to be announced next week, on January 25. \u00a0\n\n\n\nIn fiscal Q1, MSFT\u2019s cloud business surpassed $20 billion in revenues for the first time and jumped 36% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives thinks that the company\u2019s Azure cloud growth story is just starting. The analyst\u2019s checks for the December quarter have indicated that MSFT has entered into large cloud deals that could be up more than 50%, indicating such deals are gaining momentum entering into 2022.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ives believes that there is still room for Microsoft to penetrate the cloud market further, as he pegs MSFT\u2019s current cloud penetration at 35%.\n\n\n\nThe analyst also approves of MSFT\u2019s hike in the price of Office365 and thinks that it was a \u201csmart strategic poker move that could be another $5 billion+ incremental tailwind for Redmond in 2022, giving more confidence that numbers could continue to move higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nMSFT announced the price hike for its Office365 in August last year. Customers who were using a monthly subscription to Office365 faced a price rise of 20%.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to switch to remote work or a hybrid model, where people come into work at the office for certain days of the week and at other times, work remotely.\n\n\n\nAnalyst Ives expects this trend will continue and will benefit companies providing cloud computing services like MSFT, Amazon (AMZN) with its Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM (IBM), and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\n\n\nBy the analyst\u2019s estimate, the number of companies maintaining their workloads in the cloud will increase from 43% currently to 55% by the end of this year. What\u2019s more, Ives expects that \u201cglobal cloud spending will approach $1 trillion over the next decade,\u201d effectively representing a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM) for MSFT.\n\n\n\nEven as the stock has shot up 35.96% in the past year and is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9, Ives still thinks that the stock could go up even higher over the next 6 to 9 months, \u201cas the Street is still underestimating the underlying growth story in Redmond in our opinion.\u201d\n\n\n\nMicrosoft remains one of Ives\u2019 favorite technology picks for this year and the analyst remains bullish with a Buy rating and a price target of $375 (23.6% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOverall, the rest of the analysts on the Street, are also bullish about the Microsoft growth story, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys and 1 Hold. The average MSFT stock prediction of $375.12 implies upside potential of approximately 23.7% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nThe Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is also supported by the Website traffic data tool available on TipRanks. This tool indicates that in the month of December alone, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were up 8.6% year-over-year to 1.6 billion. In calendar Q4, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have increased year-over-year by 8.5% to 4.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n\n\n\nApple, unlike technology giant Microsoft, is not in the cloud business, but the company competes with Microsoft when it comes to its personal computers business. Apple\u2019s business of manufacturing smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, wearables, and accessories suffered an impact of $6 billion in terms of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, due to supply chain constraints.\n\n\n\nThe company also stated on its earnings call that by its estimate, the adverse impact of supply chain shortages will be bigger during the December quarter, even as demand for AAPL\u2019s products continues to be high.\n\n\n\nApple is expected to announce its December quarter results on January 27.\n\n\n\nThe company elaborated more on the supply chain constraints on its September quarter earnings call. While Apple expects that revenues will continue to show an upward trend for most of its categories, the company estimates that iPad revenues could trend downward in the December quarter due to these supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nDo Wall Street analysts continue to see this trend persisting, just before its December quarter?\n\n\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt didn\u2019t mention the iPad revenues but continues to see upside in iPhone and iMac, fueled by strong demand. That has led him Vogt raise his estimates for fiscal Q1 (December quarter) revenues from $117.5 billion to $119.6 billion and earnings from $1.85 per share to $1.91 per share.\n\n\n\nThe analyst added, \u201cDespite near-term iPhone strength, we keep our FY2022 iPhone unit estimate unchanged at 230M as we prefer to be conservative given lingering supply chain headwinds and uncertain carrier promotional activity next fall and winter.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoreover, the analyst\u2019s channel checks indicated that supply chain challenges continued to improve on a month-over-month basis during the fiscal Q1 quarter. Vogt also mentioned that consumers continued to prefer high-end iPhone models like Pro and Max and are more likely to spend more than $1,000 on the iPhone.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the analyst raised his estimate for iPhone units by 3% from around 52.3 million to 53.8 million units for the March quarter. The analyst remained upbeat about the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $175 (5.3% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOther analysts on the Street echo Vogt and are also upbeat about Apple, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Apple stock forecast of $179.80 implies upside potential of approximately 8.2% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nBut the Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is contrary to the Website Traffic data available on TipRanks. This data indicates that in the month of December alone, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were down 7.8% year-over-year to 241.1 million. In calendar Q4, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have also declined year-over-year 6.2% to 756.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 bullish stance on both stocks seems to be justified, considering that both companies are poised for growth, with MSFT and its cloud business and AAPL's effective management of supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MSFT seems to be a better Buy.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks mobile app now.\n\n\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\n\n\nRead full Disclaimer & Disclosure."," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=27bd8e255f1b45f6919478f8f1c4a259fa73e0a8ac68a0897517e050acd03d9d"}

{"Ticker":"AAPL","Date":1642658700,"Headline":"Microsoft vs. Apple: Which Stock is Headed for Growth in 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"When it comes to pure-play technology companies like Microsoft and Apple, website traffic data is an important tool. This is because, for these companies, most of the retailing takes place online. This is especially true when it comes to selling software and devices such as smartphones, PCs, and wearables to individual customers.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks stock comparison tool, we will compare two technology giants, Microsoft and Apple, and see whether their performance in the December quarter can be gauged using the Website Traffic tool on TipRanks. We will also look at what Wall Street analysts are saying about these stocks.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\n\n\nMicrosoft dominated the headlines recently as it announced an all-cash acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for $68.7 billion. Analysts believe that this acquisition will extend the company\u2019s footprint in the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nWhile this acquisition bodes well for MSFT when it comes to its gaming business, it will be interesting to see how MSFT\u2019s key cloud business fares in the upcoming earnings for fiscal Q2. MSFT earnings for fiscal Q2 are expected to be announced next week, on January 25. \u00a0\n\n\n\nIn fiscal Q1, MSFT\u2019s cloud business surpassed $20 billion in revenues for the first time and jumped 36% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives thinks that the company\u2019s Azure cloud growth story is just starting. The analyst\u2019s checks for the December quarter have indicated that MSFT has entered into large cloud deals that could be up more than 50%, indicating such deals are gaining momentum entering into 2022.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ives believes that there is still room for Microsoft to penetrate the cloud market further, as he pegs MSFT\u2019s current cloud penetration at 35%.\n\n\n\nThe analyst also approves of MSFT\u2019s hike in the price of Office365 and thinks that it was a \u201csmart strategic poker move that could be another $5 billion+ incremental tailwind for Redmond in 2022, giving more confidence that numbers could continue to move higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nMSFT announced the price hike for its Office365 in August last year. Customers who were using a monthly subscription to Office365 faced a price rise of 20%.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to switch to remote work or a hybrid model, where people come into work at the office for certain days of the week and at other times, work remotely.\n\n\n\nAnalyst Ives expects this trend will continue and will benefit companies providing cloud computing services like MSFT, Amazon (AMZN) with its Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM (IBM), and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\n\n\nBy the analyst\u2019s estimate, the number of companies maintaining their workloads in the cloud will increase from 43% currently to 55% by the end of this year. What\u2019s more, Ives expects that \u201cglobal cloud spending will approach $1 trillion over the next decade,\u201d effectively representing a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM) for MSFT.\n\n\n\nEven as the stock has shot up 35.96% in the past year and is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9, Ives still thinks that the stock could go up even higher over the next 6 to 9 months, \u201cas the Street is still underestimating the underlying growth story in Redmond in our opinion.\u201d\n\n\n\nMicrosoft remains one of Ives\u2019 favorite technology picks for this year and the analyst remains bullish with a Buy rating and a price target of $375 (23.6% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOverall, the rest of the analysts on the Street, are also bullish about the Microsoft growth story, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys and 1 Hold. The average MSFT stock prediction of $375.12 implies upside potential of approximately 23.7% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nThe Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is also supported by the Website traffic data tool available on TipRanks. This tool indicates that in the month of December alone, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were up 8.6% year-over-year to 1.6 billion. In calendar Q4, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have increased year-over-year by 8.5% to 4.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n\n\n\nApple, unlike technology giant Microsoft, is not in the cloud business, but the company competes with Microsoft when it comes to its personal computers business. Apple\u2019s business of manufacturing smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, wearables, and accessories suffered an impact of $6 billion in terms of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, due to supply chain constraints.\n\n\n\nThe company also stated on its earnings call that by its estimate, the adverse impact of supply chain shortages will be bigger during the December quarter, even as demand for AAPL\u2019s products continues to be high.\n\n\n\nApple is expected to announce its December quarter results on January 27.\n\n\n\nThe company elaborated more on the supply chain constraints on its September quarter earnings call. While Apple expects that revenues will continue to show an upward trend for most of its categories, the company estimates that iPad revenues could trend downward in the December quarter due to these supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nDo Wall Street analysts continue to see this trend persisting, just before its December quarter?\n\n\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt didn\u2019t mention the iPad revenues but continues to see upside in iPhone and iMac, fueled by strong demand. That has led him Vogt raise his estimates for fiscal Q1 (December quarter) revenues from $117.5 billion to $119.6 billion and earnings from $1.85 per share to $1.91 per share.\n\n\n\nThe analyst added, \u201cDespite near-term iPhone strength, we keep our FY2022 iPhone unit estimate unchanged at 230M as we prefer to be conservative given lingering supply chain headwinds and uncertain carrier promotional activity next fall and winter.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoreover, the analyst\u2019s channel checks indicated that supply chain challenges continued to improve on a month-over-month basis during the fiscal Q1 quarter. Vogt also mentioned that consumers continued to prefer high-end iPhone models like Pro and Max and are more likely to spend more than $1,000 on the iPhone.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the analyst raised his estimate for iPhone units by 3% from around 52.3 million to 53.8 million units for the March quarter. The analyst remained upbeat about the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $175 (5.3% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOther analysts on the Street echo Vogt and are also upbeat about Apple, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Apple stock forecast of $179.80 implies upside potential of approximately 8.2% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nBut the Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is contrary to the Website Traffic data available on TipRanks. This data indicates that in the month of December alone, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were down 7.8% year-over-year to 241.1 million. In calendar Q4, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have also declined year-over-year 6.2% to 756.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 bullish stance on both stocks seems to be justified, considering that both companies are poised for growth, with MSFT and its cloud business and AAPL's effective management of supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MSFT seems to be a better Buy.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks mobile app now.\n\n\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\n\n\nRead full Disclaimer & Disclosure."," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=27bd8e255f1b45f6919478f8f1c4a259fa73e0a8ac68a0897517e050acd03d9d"}
