{"Ticker":"TSLA","Date":1641825960,"Headline":"Tesla Stock: Is Tech Edge Enough over Competitors?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"I am neutral on Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) as it has a very strong moat, rapid growth momentum, and a compelling technological edge that should serve it well moving forward. \n\n\n\nOn the other hand, it trades a massive valuation multiple premium.\n\n\n\nTesla is a manufacturer of home power storage and car batteries, solar panels, and EVs. The EV manufacturing company was founded in 2003; the company gained massive following after the release of Tesla Roadster, the world\u2019s first electric sports car. \n\n\n\nIts customers are spread across the globe and Tesla has over 70,757 employees in total, according to the 2020 reports. Its factory is located in Fremont, California, and the headquarters are in Austin, Texas. \n\n\n\nIt is also known as one of the most valuable automakers in the industry that is constantly working toward sustainable, budget-friendly solutions for its targeted customer base.\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Tesla\u2019s Model 3 became the first electric car to cross the 1-million mark for total units sold across the globe. Innovative capabilities and a niche target audience give this company a greater competitive edge than some its competitors in the industry. \n\n\n\nIn 2019, Tesla was also named one of the best employers of the year by Forbes, and its employment rate has only increased since then. Highly skilled and talented employees aside, the company is also known as the leading automotive company, after the spike in Tesla Model 3 sales. \n\n\n\nThe strong brand image and customer-focused approach give Tesla robust brand equity.\n\n\n\nRecent Results\n\n\n\nIn 2020, the total revenues generated by Tesla reached $31.5 billion and gross profit reached $6.6 billion. In 2019, these numbers totaled $24.6 billion and $4.1 billion, respectively. The basic and diluted earnings per share finally showed a positive trend since the 2016 results, with $0.74 and $0.64 attributed to them, respectively.\n\n\n\nThe gross margin also increased to 21% in 2020, compared to 17% and 19% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. The R&D expenses as a percentage of revenues remained consistent between 2019 and 2020 at 5%.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, TSLA has seen massive growth, with revenues expected to rise by 65.3%, EBITDA expected to soar by 88%, and normalized net income expected to nearly triple. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nValuation Metrics\n\n\n\nTSLA stock looks richly priced at the moment. Its enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio is high relative to its history at 63.4x compared to its historical average of 40.7x. \n\n\n\nMoreover, its P\/E ratio is also very elevated at 111.5x compared to its historical average of 66.4x.\n\n\n\nWall Street\u2019s Take\n\n\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, TSLA earns a Moderate Buy analyst consensus based on 15 Buy ratings, nine Hold ratings, and six Sell ratings in the past three months. Additionally, the average Tesla price target of $1,028.59 puts the upside potential at 0.2%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n\n\nTesla is a clear global leader in EVs as it boasts best-in-class technology, particularly on the battery front. \n\n\n\nIt is led by visionary CEO Elon Musk, has finally proven that it can be profitable, is growing rapidly, and it also possesses a compelling advantage in artificial intelligence and autonomous driving technology. The future certainly looks bright for the company.\n\n\n\nThat said, the stock has soared in recent years which means that the valuation is extremely stretched.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRead full Disclaimer\u00a0& Disclosure"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=c19662fe186a7382a14b47b012927f4b7e7821a79a88f49c677da2b0ceaa81d8"}

{"Ticker":"TSLA","Date":1641795000,"Headline":"Tesla vs. NIO: Which EV Stock Will Gear Up in 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Electric vehicles, or EV stocks, have been dominating the headlines recently, as their Q4 production and delivery numbers trickle in. Competition is also heating up in this sector, as new entrants like Rivian (RIVN) gear up to compete with existing incumbents like Tesla.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla is eyeing new markets like India, as the EV market globally is getting a boost with a friendly regulatory environment and government initiatives.\n\n\n\nUsing the stock comparison tool, let us compare two EV stocks, Tesla and NIO, and predict whether the uptick in Q4 delivery numbers could continue, using the website traffic data for these companies as a gauge.\n\n\n\nTesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\n\n\nTesla investors cheered in the New Year as the EV giant said that it had delivered 308,000 vehicles in Q4, a 27.6% jump in vehicle deliveries, quarter-over-quarter. In full-year 2021, it delivered 936,172 vehicles versus 499,647 vehicles that the company delivered in 2020 \u2013 a rise of 87% year-over-year. \u00a0The company\u2019s vehicle deliveries were also a notch above consensus estimates of 893,755.\n\n\n\nThe stellar delivery numbers came in at a time when automobile manufacturers were plagued by supply shortages.\n\n\n\nThe strong delivery numbers led Mizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh to be positive about TSLA's performance in 2022, as the company\u2019s factories in Austin and Berlin start production of its cars. Moreover, the analyst pointed out that the rise in deliveries of TSLA\u2019s Cybertruck and 4680 batteries would result in the expansion of TSLA\u2019s portfolio \u201cinto additional auto segments and driving down the battery cost curve.\u201d\n\n\n\nTSLA is focusing on lowering battery costs and adding to its available sources of supply of battery cells by manufacturing its own battery cells.\n\n\n\nWhile Rakesh believes that the company\u2019s gross margins could improve over time, 2022 could see some gross margin headwinds as initial production at Tesla\u2019s factories in Texas and Berlin gradually ramps up. At least at the outset, the full potential capacity of these plants could be underutilized.\n\n\n\nTSLA delivered a gross margin of 26.6% in Q3 on revenues of $13.76 billion.\n\n\n\nThe analyst remains bullish on the stock with a Buy rating and raised the price target from $950 to $1300 (26.6% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nRest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock with a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, 9 Holds, and 5 Sells. The average Tesla stock prediction of $1,053.73 implies upside potential of 2.6% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nIt is important here to note that TSLA also sells its EVs through its website, and visits to its website are telling. An indication of the strong delivery numbers in Q4 is also supported by the company\u2019s Website traffic data. \n\n\n\nThis data, provided by SEMrush Holdings (SEMR) and available through the TipRanks Website Traffic tool, indicates that in Q4, unique visitors to the TSLA website were up 5.1% year-over-year and increased approximately 8.9%, quarter-over-quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNIO (NYSE: NIO)\n\n\n\nNIO designs, develops and manufactures premium electric vehicles. The company\u2019s main market is China, but it has also made a foray into the European market.\n\n\n\nThis EV maker also delivered stellar delivery numbers and achieved a new quarterly record in Q4. The company delivered 25,034 vehicles in Q4, up 44.3% year-over-year and 10,489 vehicles in December alone, an increase of around 50% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nNIO\u2019s vehicle deliveries in 2021 soared 109.1% year-over-year to 91,429 vehicles.\n\n\n\nMizuho Securities analyst Vijay Rakesh was upbeat about these delivery numbers, in spite of production constraints due to supply chain shortages and \u201cproduction line upgrades.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe analyst is optimistic about NIO\u2019s 2022 performance, as the company increases production and plans to launch its ET7 and ET5 sedans in March and September this year, respectively. NIO is also ramping up its plans to expand globally, including in countries like Norway, Germany, and the Netherlands.\n\n\n\nET7 is the company\u2019s flagship premium smart electric sedan while ET5 is NIO\u2019s mid-sized premium smart electric sedan.\n\n\n\nRakesh believes that the company\u2019s ET5 could be a \u201cviable competitor to the Tesla Model 3\u201d and Lucid Group\u2019s (LCID) vehicles.\n\n\n\nThe analyst is upbeat, with a Buy rating and a price target of $65 (121.8% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nRest of the analysts echo Rakesh and are bullish with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 7 Buys and 1 Hold. The average NIO stock prediction of $61.86 implies upside potential of 111.1% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nNIO sells its vehicles through a combination of offline sales and online sales through its mobile application.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks website traffic data for NIO, we see that total unique visitors to the NIO site on mobile are up 19.1% year-over-year in Q4. \u00a0Since China is a major market for NIO, the website traffic data for China is encouraging.\n\n\n\nInterestingly, going by the website traffic data for Tesla in China, it seems that the company continues to make waves there.\n\n\n\nTesla\u2019s unique visitors in China across all devices soared 251% in the month of December to 148,300.\n\n\n\nIn Q4, for NIO, total unique visitors to the site in China across all devices are up 22.5% year-over-year to 48,500, while monthly unique visitors in China in December were up a whopping 392.2% to 22,200.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nWhile analysts are cautiously optimistic about Tesla, they are bullish about NIO. Going by the upside over the next 12 months, NIO does seem to be a better Buy.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks mobile app now.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: At the time of publication, Shrilekha Pethe did not have a position in any of the securities mentioned in this article.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates.\u00a0 Read full Disclaimer & Disclosure"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=18c5ad3c236022e7173e37b3367f972d29f6823159e9d7f6362e6cd319b4c592"}

Meanwhile, TSLA shares closed down 3.5% at $1,026.96 on January 7.\n\n\n\nFSD Feature\n\n\n\nTesla formally released the FSD Beta Button in the last week of September to select drivers based on their safety scores. In October 2022, the price of the FSD was raised by $2,000 for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe latest price hike was announced by CEO Elon Musk in a tweet saying, \u201cTesla FSD price rising to $12k on January 17.\u201d The reason for the price hike remains unknown.\n\n\n\nAccording to the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) standard, Tesla\u2019s FSD feature is currently rated at Level 2, which implies that the autonomous vehicle can control both steering and speed. The level requires  the driver to be attentive and take control of the car when required.\n\n\n\nTesla regularly updates its FSD Beta feature once every two weeks. The FSD feature comes at a subscription fee of $99 per month and can be canceled at any time. The feature includes navigation on Autopilot Beta, auto lane change, smart summon, Traffic and Stop Sign control Beta, Autosteer, and Traffic-Aware Cruise Control.\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 View\n\n\n\nRecently, analyst Daniel Ives of Wedbush reiterated a Buy rating on the stock with a price target of $1,400, which implies 36.3% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ives, Tesla\u2019s Giga factories in Berlin and Austin are a focal point for the Street. Ives is very optimistic about the production of Model Y, which he believes will have a massive year in 2022.\n\n\n\nThe analyst said, \u201cBased on our analysis of Giga Austin it appears paperwork is now clearing the way for Model Y production starting over the next 7-10 days. We also believe the stamping machines for Model Y and testing is already in place and mostly completed, with paperwork now filed by Tesla to officially start key production in Austin over the next week.\u201d\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, 9 Holds, and 5 Sells.

{"Ticker":"TSLA","Date":1641878820,"Headline":"Tesla Inks First U.S. Nickel Supply Deal with Talon Metals","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Tesla,\u00a0Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA)\u00a0has\u00a0inked a deal with\u00a0Talon Nickel LLC, the U.S. subsidiary of\u00a0Talon Metals Corp.\u00a0(TSX: TLO),\u00a0for the purchase of nickel concentrate to be produced from the Tamarack Nickel Project in Aitkin County, Minnesota. The EV maker plans to make\u00a0the electric vehicle battery metal in a more\u00a0environmentally-friendly manner.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTalon is a base metals company in a joint venture with\u00a0Rio Tinto\u00a0on the high-grade Tamarack Nickel Project. Talon currently owns a 51% interest in the Tamarack Project and has the right to increase its stake by 9% to 60%.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBenefits of the Deal\u00a0\n\n\n\nDemand for nickel is expected to jump over the next decade on the growing momentum in the EV market. Notably, Nickel boosts energy storage in a battery's cathode, which in turn, extends the range of EVs.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTherefore, the deal with Talon secures Tesla\u2019s key U.S. source of the metal for its battery factories in Texas and Nevada. Last year, Tesla signed nickel supply deals with BHP in Australia and from New Caledonia.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTerms\u00a0of the Agreement\u00a0\n\n\n\nPer the terms of the agreement, Tesla will purchase 75,000 metric tonnes (165 million pounds) of nickel in concentrate over a period of six years. Additionally, the company has a preferential right to purchase additional nickel concentrate over and above the committed 75,000 metric tonnes if needed.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe agreement is conditional on Talon earning a 60% interest in the Tamarack Nickel Project, the commencement of commercial production at the Tamarack Nickel Project by Talon, and the execution of detailed supply terms and conditions.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nTalon is expected to commence commercial production on or before January 1, 2026, at the Tamarack Nickel Project, which might be extended for up to 12 months,\u00a0following\u00a0which Tesla has the right to terminate the agreement and Talon can sell to other parties.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNotably, the price at which Tesla will purchase the nickel concentrate will be linked to the London Metals Exchange (LME) official nickel cash settlement price. Also,\u00a0any additional economics gained from by-products of the nickel concentrate, such as iron and cobalt, will be shared by both parties.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOfficial Comments\u00a0\n\n\n\nSVP of Powertrain and Energy Engineering at Tesla,\u00a0Drew\u00a0Baglino, said, \u201cThe Talon team has taken an innovative approach to the discovery, development and production of battery materials, including to permanently store carbon as part of mine operations and the investigation of the novel extraction of battery materials. Responsible sourcing of battery materials has long been a focus for Tesla, and this project has the promise to accelerate the production of sustainable energy products in North America.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nAnalyst Recommendations\u00a0\n\n\n\nYesterday,\u00a0Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney\u00a0maintained a Buy rating on Tesla and lifted the price target to $1,200 (13.41% upside potential) from $1,125.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nDelaney\u00a0increased his estimates to reflect \"robust\" deliveries in the fourth quarter, and he expects the company to sell more vehicles in 2022 and 2023.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the analyst anticipates Tesla to expand margins in the intermediate term driven by its Model Y product and new factories in Berlin, Germany, and Austin, Texas.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThe rest of the Street is cautiously optimistic about the stock, with\u00a0a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, 9 Holds, and 5 Sells. The\u00a0average\u00a0Tesla stock forecast\u00a0of\u00a0$1,053.73 implies that shares are fully valued at current levels. Shares have gained 24.6% over the past year.\u00a0\n\n\n\nWebsite Traffic\u00a0\n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Website Traffic Tool, which uses data from SEMrush Holdings (NYSE:\u00a0SEMR), the world\u2019s biggest website usage monitoring service, offers insight into Tesla\u2019s performance.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\n\nAccording to the tool, the\u00a0Tesla website recorded a 7.33% decrease in global visits in December\u00a0compared to the same period last year. Also, a quarter-to-date comparison showed a decline of 6.71% compared to Q4 2020, while year-to-date website traffic growth stands at 0.95%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0&\u00a0Disclosure\n\n\n\nRelated News:\u00a0Ocugen Reveals Positive Results from Phase 2 Analysis of COVAXIN\u00a0FedEx Operations Affected by Omicron & Bad Weather \u2013 Report\u00a0Bank of America to Reward Employees with Higher Bonuses \u2013 Report"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=a0bfcdd3db44411151bbdd091f6760324cc709f0d601431c482fed970f3ea3ac"}

{"Ticker":"TSLA","Date":1641949320,"Headline":"Tesla Reports Solid China Sales Numbers for December; Shares Up","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"One of the most popular EV stocks Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) reported solid delivery numbers for December 2021 in China. Following the news, shares rose as much as 1.7% and ended the day at $1,064.40 on January 11.\n\n\n\nTesla China December Deliveries\n\n\n\nAccording to the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA), Tesla China delivered a total of 70,847 electric vehicles (EV), a massive year-over-year growth of 197.6% and a solid 34% sequential growth.\n\n\n\nOut of the total cars delivered, 70,602 cars were delivered locally and only 245 cars were delivered internationally. In November 2021, Tesla China reported wholesale numbers totaling 52,859 autos, which in itself is a massive feat. \n\n\n\nIf the raw production numbers were anywhere close to the wholesale numbers, it would translate into an annual run rate of more than 800,000 autos even before 2021 ended.\n\n\n\nDomestic V\/S International Deliveries\n\n\n\nA look at the domestic and international breakup of Tesla China deliveries shows that the company typically focuses on export deliveries in the first half of every quarter and stresses the importance of local deliveries during the latter half.\n\n\n\nGoing by numbers reported in the fourth quarter, in October, Tesla China delivered a little more than 13,000 local vehicles and in November, the company sold around 31,700 local vehicles. Following the upward trend, in December, Tesla China sold 70,602 vehicles locally.\n\n\n\nThis also means that Tesla China hasn\u2019t been able to focus entirely on the domestic Chinese market, which is witnessing a burgeoning demand for electric vehicles amid shifting preferences towards green energy and environment-friendly initiatives.\n\n\n\nDespite the global chip shortages and supply chain issues, Tesla China managed to deliver a total of 319,102 domestic vehicles in 2021. This number could grow even higher if the unit focuses more of its efforts on local demand.\n\n\n\nWall Street View\n\n\n\nYesterday, Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas lifted the price target on the stock to $1,500 (40.9% upside potential) from $1,200, while maintaining a Buy rating.\n\n\n\nJonas is impressed by Tesla\u2019s solid Q4 delivery numbers and sees it as a sign that the company is poised for more deliveries in 2022 and 2023. Furthermore, the analyst believes Tesla is well established to gain from its leadership position with Giga factories at Berlin and Austin, structural park, and introduction of new models all entering the narrative in 2022.\n\n\n\nOverall, the stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 15 Buys, 9 Holds, and 6 Sells. The average Tesla price target of $1,039.70 implies 2.3% downside potential to current levels. Shares have gained 24.6% over the past year.\n\n\n\nNews Sentiment\n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 News Sentiment and Media Buzz Analysis shows the combined News Score based on TSLA\u2019s News Sentiment and Media Buzz.\n\n\n\nTipRanks data shows that the News Score for Tesla is currently Neutral based on 322 articles published over the past seven days. 78% of the articles have a Bullish Sentiment compared to a sector average of 63%, while 22% of the articles have a Bearish Sentiment compared to a sector average of 37%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Best Stocks to Buy,\u00a0a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0&\u00a0Disclosure\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRelated News:JD.com Opens Robotic Stores in Europe; Shares RiseApple Provides Services Segment UpdatefuboTV Releases Preliminary Q4 Results; Shares Down 8.4%"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=aa5b9b1d8061d7882d4d8d9a9cde55d2d99b684c73a731baeb38a06936ecae75"}
