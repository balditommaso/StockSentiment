{"Ticker":"MSFT","Date":1641794100,"Headline":"Big Tech Stocks: What\u2019s in Store for 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Big tech stocks have witnessed a fair amount of selling over the past month. Valuation concerns and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic led to a selloff in tech stocks. The chart below shows that big tech companies are trading in the red, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platform (NASDAQ:FB) barely managed to stay in the green over the past month.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith tech stocks currently under pressure, let\u2019s look at each of these tech giants to ascertain what the future holds for them in 2022.\n\n\n\nApple\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite supply-chain concerns, Apple delivered a solid financial performance in FY21. Strong sales across all product categories and strength across all of its geographies drove Apple\u2019s financials, and in turn, its stock, which outperformed the benchmark index in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, demand for Apple products is likely to outpace supply, as noted by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst is bullish on Apple stock. He sees higher demand and the easing of supply-chain issues in the first half of 2022 as a tailwind for Apple stock. Moreover, Ives noted that higher average selling prices provide a multi-year growth opportunity.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBesides robust demand and higher selling prices, Ives expects Apple to gain from its growing market share in China.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, the majority of analysts are bullish on Apple stock. Its Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, hedge funds have been selling Apple stock. TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have\u00a0sold 4 million Apple shares\u00a0over the past three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAmazon\u00a0\n\n\n\nTough comparisons, cost inflation, and supply-chain disruptions weighed on Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) financial performance in 2021, and in turn, its stock price. Amazon stock underperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index by a wide margin in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGiven the near-term challenges, investors and hedge funds have a negative outlook on Amazon stock. TipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that about 1.3% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold\u00a0AMZN stock\u00a0in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, hedge funds have lowered their holdings by 576.2K shares in three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Monness analyst Brian White is bullish on Amazon for 2022. He expects Amazon\u2019s growth to accelerate in the 2H22. Further, White noted that AWS\u2019 (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, while Amazon is well-positioned to benefit from an \u201caccelerated digital transformation.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlong with White, most Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Amazon stock. AMZN has received 30 positive analyst reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlphabet\n\n\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock delivered strong returns in 2021 and outperformed its peers, thanks to the stellar recovery in ad sales and the strength of its cloud business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Alphabet could benefit from higher advertising revenues and growth in the cloud segment. Further, its balance sheet and cash flows remain strong.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTaking note of its strong cash flows, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial stated that Alphabet would continue to boost shareholders\u2019 returns through share buybacks and fund its growth initiatives on the back of its robust cash flows.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFeinseth sees Alphabet benefiting from secular tech trends, including video sharing, cloud computing, growing mobile engagement, and the ongoing shift to digital advertising, among others.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn TipRanks, Alphabet stock sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buy and 2 Hold recommendations. Furthermore,\u00a01.9% of the investors\u00a0holding portfolios on TipRanks have increased their exposure to GOOGL stock over the last 30 days.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks to the strength in its cloud business, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock increased over 49% in one year and outperformed the benchmark index. Despite the appreciation in its share price, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is upbeat about Microsoft\u2019s prospects and maintains a bullish outlook on the stock. Thill increased his price target on Microsoft to $400 from $375.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThill sees Microsoft as the \u201csafest largecap investment option\u201d with multiple growth vectors. The analyst expects Microsoft to continue to enhance shareholder value on the back of its strong profitability and free cash flows. However, he expects Microsoft\u2019s top-line growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, on TipRanks, Microsoft stock has received 24 Buys and 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating.

{"Ticker":"MSFT","Date":1641791880,"Headline":"Microsoft & Google Shares Witness Worst Drop since Pandemic","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Shares of American technology giants Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) and Alphabet Inc. Class A (GOOGL) has fallen the most in the past week, since the start of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks, MSFT declined 6.4% and GOOGL lost more than 5% in the first week of trading for the new year 2022. This has been the largest weekly slump for both companies since March 2020.\n\n\n\nRising Treasury Bond Yields\n\n\n\nThe yield on the U.S. 10-year Treasury bonds increased to 1.77% on Friday, its highest level since January 2020. The upward spike caused high growth stocks, especially technology stocks, to fall.\n\n\n\nAn increasing yield indicates an inflationary environment, which means companies will face higher borrowing costs to fund development. From the investor's perspective, a rising yield means they expect more returns on their investments. Both factors add pressure to the performance of high-growth companies.\n\n\n\nAnother factor that led to the overall downfall was the latest jobs report, which showed a slump in the unemployment rate as well as an increase in wages.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, MSFT sank by as much as 1.2% and GOOGL fell 1.4%. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF also slipped as much as 1.7% on Friday, and for the past week it was down 8.7%.\n\n\n\n2021 was a favorable year for the tech sectors as the pandemic-driven shifts led to major spending on tech services. Microsoft gained 45.6% over the past year and Alphabet gained 56%. Meanwhile, the tech-laden NASDAQ 100 gained about 25% last year.\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 Weigh In\n\n\n\nRecently, Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives issued a report about the upcoming earnings season for the disruptive technology stocks. The analyst says the Street is laser-focused on the stocks\u2019 2022 guidance.\n\n\n\nIves said, \u201cIn this vacuum of Fed news and watching every tick of the 10-year yield move on an hourly basis, tech investors wish 4Q earnings season was already here today. The absence of fundamental news for the tech space in this risk-off environment has catalyzed a brutal surge of selling tech names to kick the year off in 2022 as valuation scrutiny remains front and center for investors.\u201d\n\n\n\nMicrosoft remains his favorite large-cap stock. Ives has a Buy rating on the stock and a price target of $375, which implies 19.4% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\nOverall, the MSFT stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 24 Buys and 1 Hold. The average Microsoft price target of $371.36 implies 18.3% upside potential to current levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRelated News:Bed Bath & Beyond Misses Q3 Expectations; Meme Frenzy Drives the Shares UpNikola Signs LOI with Saia; Shares Soar Above 9%Uber to Stop Uber Eats Restaurant Delivery in Brazil"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=760c85ce392996aac0ba344d1675419c886e99e77ffbeeb27f25666a496eedc6"}

{"Ticker":"MSFT","Date":1642658700,"Headline":"Microsoft vs. Apple: Which Stock is Headed for Growth in 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"When it comes to pure-play technology companies like Microsoft and Apple, website traffic data is an important tool. This is because, for these companies, most of the retailing takes place online. This is especially true when it comes to selling software and devices such as smartphones, PCs, and wearables to individual customers.\n\n\n\nUsing the TipRanks stock comparison tool, we will compare two technology giants, Microsoft and Apple, and see whether their performance in the December quarter can be gauged using the Website Traffic tool on TipRanks. We will also look at what Wall Street analysts are saying about these stocks.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\n\n\nMicrosoft dominated the headlines recently as it announced an all-cash acquisition of Activision Blizzard (ATVI) for $68.7 billion. Analysts believe that this acquisition will extend the company\u2019s footprint in the gaming industry.\n\n\n\nWhile this acquisition bodes well for MSFT when it comes to its gaming business, it will be interesting to see how MSFT\u2019s key cloud business fares in the upcoming earnings for fiscal Q2. MSFT earnings for fiscal Q2 are expected to be announced next week, on January 25. \u00a0\n\n\n\nIn fiscal Q1, MSFT\u2019s cloud business surpassed $20 billion in revenues for the first time and jumped 36% year-over-year.\n\n\n\nWedbush analyst Daniel Ives thinks that the company\u2019s Azure cloud growth story is just starting. The analyst\u2019s checks for the December quarter have indicated that MSFT has entered into large cloud deals that could be up more than 50%, indicating such deals are gaining momentum entering into 2022.\n\n\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Ives believes that there is still room for Microsoft to penetrate the cloud market further, as he pegs MSFT\u2019s current cloud penetration at 35%.\n\n\n\nThe analyst also approves of MSFT\u2019s hike in the price of Office365 and thinks that it was a \u201csmart strategic poker move that could be another $5 billion+ incremental tailwind for Redmond in 2022, giving more confidence that numbers could continue to move higher.\u201d\n\n\n\nMSFT announced the price hike for its Office365 in August last year. Customers who were using a monthly subscription to Office365 faced a price rise of 20%.\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has forced many companies to switch to remote work or a hybrid model, where people come into work at the office for certain days of the week and at other times, work remotely.\n\n\n\nAnalyst Ives expects this trend will continue and will benefit companies providing cloud computing services like MSFT, Amazon (AMZN) with its Amazon Web Services (AWS), IBM (IBM), and Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\n\n\nBy the analyst\u2019s estimate, the number of companies maintaining their workloads in the cloud will increase from 43% currently to 55% by the end of this year. What\u2019s more, Ives expects that \u201cglobal cloud spending will approach $1 trillion over the next decade,\u201d effectively representing a $1 trillion total addressable market (TAM) for MSFT.\n\n\n\nEven as the stock has shot up 35.96% in the past year and is currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 33.9, Ives still thinks that the stock could go up even higher over the next 6 to 9 months, \u201cas the Street is still underestimating the underlying growth story in Redmond in our opinion.\u201d\n\n\n\nMicrosoft remains one of Ives\u2019 favorite technology picks for this year and the analyst remains bullish with a Buy rating and a price target of $375 (23.6% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOverall, the rest of the analysts on the Street, are also bullish about the Microsoft growth story, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys and 1 Hold. The average MSFT stock prediction of $375.12 implies upside potential of approximately 23.7% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nThe Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is also supported by the Website traffic data tool available on TipRanks. This tool indicates that in the month of December alone, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were up 8.6% year-over-year to 1.6 billion. In calendar Q4, Microsoft\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have increased year-over-year by 8.5% to 4.9 billion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL)\n\n\n\nApple, unlike technology giant Microsoft, is not in the cloud business, but the company competes with Microsoft when it comes to its personal computers business. Apple\u2019s business of manufacturing smartphones, personal computers (PCs), tablets, wearables, and accessories suffered an impact of $6 billion in terms of revenues in the fiscal fourth quarter, due to supply chain constraints.\n\n\n\nThe company also stated on its earnings call that by its estimate, the adverse impact of supply chain shortages will be bigger during the December quarter, even as demand for AAPL\u2019s products continues to be high.\n\n\n\nApple is expected to announce its December quarter results on January 27.\n\n\n\nThe company elaborated more on the supply chain constraints on its September quarter earnings call. While Apple expects that revenues will continue to show an upward trend for most of its categories, the company estimates that iPad revenues could trend downward in the December quarter due to these supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nDo Wall Street analysts continue to see this trend persisting, just before its December quarter?\n\n\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt didn\u2019t mention the iPad revenues but continues to see upside in iPhone and iMac, fueled by strong demand. That has led him Vogt raise his estimates for fiscal Q1 (December quarter) revenues from $117.5 billion to $119.6 billion and earnings from $1.85 per share to $1.91 per share.\n\n\n\nThe analyst added, \u201cDespite near-term iPhone strength, we keep our FY2022 iPhone unit estimate unchanged at 230M as we prefer to be conservative given lingering supply chain headwinds and uncertain carrier promotional activity next fall and winter.\u201d\n\n\n\nMoreover, the analyst\u2019s channel checks indicated that supply chain challenges continued to improve on a month-over-month basis during the fiscal Q1 quarter. Vogt also mentioned that consumers continued to prefer high-end iPhone models like Pro and Max and are more likely to spend more than $1,000 on the iPhone.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the analyst raised his estimate for iPhone units by 3% from around 52.3 million to 53.8 million units for the March quarter. The analyst remained upbeat about the stock with a Buy rating and a price target of $175 (5.3% upside) on the stock.\n\n\n\nOther analysts on the Street echo Vogt and are also upbeat about Apple, with a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 22 Buys, 4 Holds, and 1 Sell. The average Apple stock forecast of $179.80 implies upside potential of approximately 8.2% to current levels for this stock.\n\n\n\nBut the Street\u2019s bullish outlook on the stock is contrary to the Website Traffic data available on TipRanks. This data indicates that in the month of December alone, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains were down 7.8% year-over-year to 241.1 million. In calendar Q4, Apple\u2019s unique visitors across all its domains have also declined year-over-year 6.2% to 756.7 million.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBottom Line\n\n\n\nAnalysts\u2019 bullish stance on both stocks seems to be justified, considering that both companies are poised for growth, with MSFT and its cloud business and AAPL's effective management of supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nBased on the upside potential over the next 12 months, MSFT seems to be a better Buy.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks mobile app now.\n\n\n\nTo find good ideas for stocks trading at attractive valuations, visit TipRanks\u2019 Best Stocks to Buy, a newly launched tool that unites all of TipRanks\u2019 equity insights.\n\n\n\nRead full Disclaimer & Disclosure."," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=27bd8e255f1b45f6919478f8f1c4a259fa73e0a8ac68a0897517e050acd03d9d"}
