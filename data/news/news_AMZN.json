{"Ticker":"AMZN","Date":1641812820,"Headline":"Amazon: Long Growth Runway Provides Meaningful Upside Potential","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Amazon (AMZN) is one of the top five companies in the United States that is working in the information technology industry. The company focuses on e-commerce, AI, digital streaming, and cloud computing. Headquartered in Seattle, Washington, the company was founded in 1994, and since then, its team has grown marginally. \n\n\n\nIn 2020, the multinational company had 1,298,000 employees working in either full-time or part-time capacity. In the same year, Amazon also reported total net revenue of $386 billion. Its offices are located in 36 different countries, with the total number of locations reaching 235.\n\n\n\nI am bullish on Amazon as it has strong growth potential, a wide moat, a discounted valuation, unanimous Wall Street bullishness, and substantial upside relative to its one-year price target.\n\n\n\nStrengths\n\n\n\nAmazon has tapped into three different but equally vast industries, including retail, internet, and consumer electronics industries. It has a significant global footprint, with Amazon Marketplace serving 17 countries in total. \n\n\n\nBetween 2018 and 2019, the company saw a massive increase in its revenues and profits, a 20.5% and 15% increase, respectively. Its low price structures, significant number of third-party sellers, and the largest merchandise selection have earned it the rightful place in the market. \n\n\n\nIt has created unrivaled synergies between four different marketplaces through the various businesses it runs, including Marketplace, Prime, Web Services, and Subscription services. The technological advancements have allowed the company to cope with larger capacities and enhance customer satisfaction at a fraction of the costs.\n\n\n\nRecent Results\n\n\n\nAmazon\u2019s net sales reached $386 billion in the year ended December 31, 2020. In 2019, the net sales were at $280.5 billion, which means the total year-over-year growth percentage for 2020 was approximately 38%. \n\n\n\nNet income increased from $11.59 billion in 2019 to $21.33 billion in 2020. Additionally, the cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year also increased from $36.1 billion to $42.27 billion in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share reached $42.64 and $41.83, respectively. The year before that, these numbers stood at $23.46 and $23.01, respectively\n\n\n\nValuation Metrics\n\n\n\nAMZN stock looks attractively valued at the moment. It currently trades at a 22.3x forward enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio, which looks quite reasonable compared to its historical average of 23.1x. Furthermore, its forward price-to-normalized-earnings ratio of 83.3x is well below its historical average of 100.5x.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, growth is expected to be strong in the coming years, with EBITDA expected to grow by 23% in 2022 and normalized earnings-per-share expected to grow by 28.9% in 2022.\n\n\n\nWall Street\u2019s Take\n\n\n\nAccording to Wall Street analysts, AMZN earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 30 Buy ratings and no Hold or Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. Additionally, the average\u00a0Amazon price target\u00a0of $4,137.5 puts the upside potential at 31.7%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary and Conclusions\n\n\n\nAmazon is a leader across many industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. It has a wide moat with a vaunted logistics infrastructure underpinning its dominant online presence. Given that it operates in innovative and disruptive industries, it has a lengthy growth runway that makes its current valuation multiples look very reasonable.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, Wall Street is unanimously bullish on the stock, and the average price target implies substantial upside for the share price over the next year. As a result, it looks like it might be a good time to add shares.\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nRead full\u00a0Disclaimer\u00a0&\u00a0Disclosure"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=0c35fe3aa6d7541cc0a6bd5d7a3016b05b492de167ae96f5be0d13d23c87b39e"}

{"Ticker":"AMZN","Date":1641794100,"Headline":"Big Tech Stocks: What\u2019s in Store for 2022?","Source":"Nasdaq","Summary":"Big tech stocks have witnessed a fair amount of selling over the past month. Valuation concerns and uncertainty regarding the COVID-19 pandemic led to a selloff in tech stocks. The chart below shows that big tech companies are trading in the red, while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Meta Platform (NASDAQ:FB) barely managed to stay in the green over the past month.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith tech stocks currently under pressure, let\u2019s look at each of these tech giants to ascertain what the future holds for them in 2022.\n\n\n\nApple\u00a0\n\n\n\nDespite supply-chain concerns, Apple delivered a solid financial performance in FY21. Strong sales across all product categories and strength across all of its geographies drove Apple\u2019s financials, and in turn, its stock, which outperformed the benchmark index in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, demand for Apple products is likely to outpace supply, as noted by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives. The analyst is bullish on Apple stock. He sees higher demand and the easing of supply-chain issues in the first half of 2022 as a tailwind for Apple stock. Moreover, Ives noted that higher average selling prices provide a multi-year growth opportunity.\u00a0\n\n\n\nBesides robust demand and higher selling prices, Ives expects Apple to gain from its growing market share in China.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, the majority of analysts are bullish on Apple stock. Its Strong Buy consensus rating is based on 21 Buys, 3 Holds, and 1 Sell. However, hedge funds have been selling Apple stock. TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have\u00a0sold 4 million Apple shares\u00a0over the past three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAmazon\u00a0\n\n\n\nTough comparisons, cost inflation, and supply-chain disruptions weighed on Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ:AMZN) financial performance in 2021, and in turn, its stock price. Amazon stock underperformed the Nasdaq 100 Index by a wide margin in 2021.\u00a0\n\n\n\nGiven the near-term challenges, investors and hedge funds have a negative outlook on Amazon stock. TipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that about 1.3% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold\u00a0AMZN stock\u00a0in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, hedge funds have lowered their holdings by 576.2K shares in three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNevertheless, Monness analyst Brian White is bullish on Amazon for 2022. He expects Amazon\u2019s growth to accelerate in the 2H22. Further, White noted that AWS\u2019 (Amazon Web Services) revenue growth has accelerated over the past three quarters, while Amazon is well-positioned to benefit from an \u201caccelerated digital transformation.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlong with White, most Wall Street analysts maintain a bullish outlook on Amazon stock. AMZN has received 30 positive analyst reviews for a unanimous Strong Buy consensus rating.\u00a0\n\n\n\nAlphabet\n\n\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock delivered strong returns in 2021 and outperformed its peers, thanks to the stellar recovery in ad sales and the strength of its cloud business.\u00a0\n\n\n\nLooking ahead, Alphabet could benefit from higher advertising revenues and growth in the cloud segment. Further, its balance sheet and cash flows remain strong.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTaking note of its strong cash flows, Ivan Feinseth of Tigress Financial stated that Alphabet would continue to boost shareholders\u2019 returns through share buybacks and fund its growth initiatives on the back of its robust cash flows.\u00a0\n\n\n\nFeinseth sees Alphabet benefiting from secular tech trends, including video sharing, cloud computing, growing mobile engagement, and the ongoing shift to digital advertising, among others.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOn TipRanks, Alphabet stock sports a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 26 Buy and 2 Hold recommendations. Furthermore,\u00a01.9% of the investors\u00a0holding portfolios on TipRanks have increased their exposure to GOOGL stock over the last 30 days.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMicrosoft\u00a0\n\n\n\nThanks to the strength in its cloud business, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock increased over 49% in one year and outperformed the benchmark index. Despite the appreciation in its share price, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill is upbeat about Microsoft\u2019s prospects and maintains a bullish outlook on the stock. Thill increased his price target on Microsoft to $400 from $375.\u00a0\n\n\n\nThill sees Microsoft as the \u201csafest largecap investment option\u201d with multiple growth vectors. The analyst expects Microsoft to continue to enhance shareholder value on the back of its strong profitability and free cash flows. However, he expects Microsoft\u2019s top-line growth to moderate a bit in the coming quarters.\u00a0\n\n\n\nOverall, on TipRanks, Microsoft stock has received 24 Buys and 1 Hold for a Strong Buy consensus rating. Furthermore, it scores a 9 out of 10 on TipRanks\u2019\u00a0Smart Score system, indicating that MSFT stock could outperform the market averages.\n\n\n\nMeta Platforms\u00a0\n\n\n\nFacebook changed its name to Meta Platforms to better reflect a metaverse company. However, investors and hedge funds continue to dump their stock.\u00a0\n\n\n\nTipRanks\u2019 Stock Investors tool shows that about 0.7% of investors holding portfolios on TipRanks have sold\u00a0FB stock\u00a0in the last 30 days. Meanwhile, TipRanks\u2019 Hedge Fund Trading Activity tool shows that hedge funds have\u00a0sold 1.7 million Meta Platforms\u00a0shares over the past three months.\u00a0\n\n\n\nMonness analyst Brian White noted, \u201cThe longer-term journey for Facebook became more intriguing in the later part of 2021 with the company introducing its vision for the metaverse, followed by a name change to Meta Platforms.\u201d\u00a0\n\n\n\nHowever, he expects Apple\u2019s app tracking transparency to continue to hurt Meta Platforms in the future.\u00a0\n\n\n\nNevertheless, he maintains a Buy rating on Meta Platforms and expects it to benefit from favorable digital ad trends and digital transformation opportunities. Meanwhile, on TipRanks, FB stock has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 28 Buys and 5 Holds.\u00a0\n\n\n\nDownload the TipRanks\u00a0mobile app\u00a0now\n\n\n\nDisclosure: On the date of publication, Amit Singh had no position in any of the companies discussed in this article.\n\n\n\nDisclaimer:\u00a0The information contained in this article represents the views and opinion of the writer only, and not the views or opinion of TipRanks or its affiliates \u00a0Read full disclaimer >"," Url":null,"Url":"https:\/\/finnhub.io\/api\/news?id=1ad7ecad6f79af73a490aeb5d07b2c44237170a1621ad933f89c841e7c8d7063"}
